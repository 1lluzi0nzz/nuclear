          I used nuclear and had a horrible experience with it. It looks bad, you wait for 1 minute to play a 3 minute
          song, it's slow as fuck. Probably it's because of Electron, but it is used by so many people that I started
          cringing.

          How incredibly arrogant. (...) High-and-mighty types like this are exactly why working in IT or contributing
          to FLOSS is so draining at times.
